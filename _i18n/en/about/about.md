Hello, I am OÄŸuzcan! I started programming in March 2016.
Currently I am studying **Computer Technologies and Information
Systems** at **Trakya University**.

I met with software development by searching **"how to program
computers"** out of curiosity on the internet.
After I learned basic programming concepts from some [MOOC]s,
I decided to improve myself on **backend development**. 
I am mostly using `NodeJS`. Also, I am interested in `artificial
intelligence` subjects like `machine learning` and `deep learning`.
After I see myself sufficient enough at backend development,
I am planning to get involved in those subjects and the math concepts
they base on.

I'm a very lazy person for some things. For example, all housework
is a big problem for me. Sometimes I don't eat food just for
not having to wash dishes. But don't worry; software is a subject
that I care about not being lazy at. I think developing 
software is a very cool thing and I am constantly trying to be
better to be able to call myself **a good software developer**.
